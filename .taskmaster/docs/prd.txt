# CellSorter - Cell Selection Management Feature PRD

## Overview
Enhance the cell selection functionality to provide granular control over individual cells within a well selection, allowing users to review and manage cells before protocol export.

## Background
Currently, when users perform cell selection, all selected cells are assigned to a single well. Users need the ability to:
1. Preview selected cells before saving
2. Selectively save only desired cells
3. Remove unwanted cells from the protocol

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Cell Selection Preview
- After cell selection, display a preview of all selected cells
- Show which cells will be included in the well assignment
- Provide visual feedback before final save operation

### 2. Row-by-Row Cell Management
- Enable examination of individual cells within each row
- Allow users to inspect cell quality and characteristics
- Provide checkbox interface for cell inclusion/exclusion

### 3. Manage ROIs Dialog
- Add "Manage ROIs" button in Cell selections widget (top-right area)
- Button appears when a row is clicked/selected
- Opens dedicated dialog for cell management

### 4. ROI Management Dialog Features
- Display list of all individual cells in the selected row
- Show cell images/thumbnails for visual inspection
- Checkbox for each cell to include/exclude from protocol
- NO ability to change well assignment or label colors
- Click on cell image centers that cell in main image view

### 5. Main Image Navigation
- When cell is clicked in ROI dialog, center that cell in left main image
- Smooth navigation to selected cell location
- Visual highlighting of currently selected cell

## Technical Requirements

### Development Mode Testing
- All functionality must be testable in DEV mode
- Comprehensive logging for all operations
- Headless simulation of all user interactions
- Validation through test suite execution

### GUI Design
- Maintain design system harmony with existing interface
- Follow CellSorter design tokens and style guidelines
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Consistent interaction patterns

### Three-Mode Implementation
- DEV Mode: Headless simulation + comprehensive logging
- DUAL Mode: GUI synchronization validation
- GUI Mode: Production-ready user interface

## User Workflow
1. User performs cell selection (existing functionality)
2. User clicks on a row in the selection results
3. "Manage ROIs" button appears in Cell selections widget
4. User clicks "Manage ROIs" to open dialog
5. Dialog shows all cells in that row with images
6. User can uncheck unwanted cells
7. User clicks on cell image to navigate main view
8. User confirms selection and closes dialog
9. Only checked cells are included in protocol export

## Success Criteria
- Users can preview all selected cells before saving
- Individual cells can be excluded from protocol
- Navigation between dialog and main image works seamlessly
- All functionality verified through DEV mode testing
- GUI maintains design consistency with existing interface
