# CellSorter

🧬 **Advanced Cell Sorting and Tissue Extraction Software for Pathology Research**

CellSorter bridges the gap between cellular image analysis and physical tissue extraction, enabling researchers to identify specific cell populations from microscopy images and generate precise extraction protocols for the CosmoSort hardware platform.

## 🎯 Why CellSorter?

**The Challenge:**  
Pathology researchers studying cancer and other diseases need to extract specific cell populations from tissue samples for downstream analysis. Traditional manual selection methods are time-consuming, inconsistent, and lack the precision required for modern single-cell studies.

**The Solution:**  
CellSorter automates and streamlines this critical workflow by:
- Analyzing microscopy images and CellProfiler data to identify target cells
- Providing intuitive visual selection tools for cell population identification  
- Converting pixel coordinates to precise stage coordinates for automated extraction
- Generating compatible protocol files for CosmoSort hardware execution

## 🔬 Real-World Examples

### Cancer Research
Dr. Chen analyzes colon cancer tissue to identify adenocarcinoma cells expressing specific markers (CK7+/CK20+). Using CellSorter, she:
- Loads H&E stained slide images and CellProfiler marker intensity data
- Creates scatter plots to visualize CK7 vs CK20 expression
- Selects distinct cell populations using visual clustering
- Generates extraction protocols for 150-300 cells per population
- Achieves ±2 μm coordinate accuracy for downstream single-cell RNA sequencing

### Drug Discovery  
Michael processes 20 tissue samples daily for drug efficacy studies. His standardized workflow:
- Applies consistent selection criteria across sample batches
- Uses pre-defined color schemes and labeling conventions
- Generates 96-well plate assignments for systematic processing
- Maintains <5% error rate across different sample types
- Completes protocols 30 minutes per sample vs 2 hours manually

### Rare Cell Studies
Lisa identifies circulating tumor cells in blood samples for her dissertation:
- Analyzes 50,000+ cells to find 10-20 rare CTCs
- Uses morphological features (area, eccentricity) for detection
- Achieves >90% sensitivity with <5% false positive rate
- Documents selection criteria for reproducible methodology
