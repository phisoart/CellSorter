# Template Management System (TASK-021) - **PERMANENTLY REMOVED**

## ⚠️ FEATURE STATUS: PERMANENTLY EXCLUDED

**This feature has been permanently removed from CellSorter and will NEVER be implemented.**

## Removal Rationale

The Template Management System was originally planned but has been **permanently excluded** from CellSorter for the following reasons:

1. **Design Philosophy**: CellSorter maintains a focused, single-purpose design for cell selection and coordinate transformation
2. **Complexity Reduction**: Template management adds unnecessary complexity to the core workflow
3. **External Tools**: Users can maintain protocol documentation using external tools better suited for this purpose
4. **Direct Workflow**: The preferred approach is Image → Analysis → Export without intermediate template layers

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of built-in template management, users should:

- **Document protocols externally** using laboratory information management systems (LIMS)
- **Use CellProfiler pipelines** for standardized image analysis workflows  
- **Create standard operating procedures (SOPs)** in institutional documentation systems
- **Export .cxprotocol files** as reference protocols for reproducible workflows

## Original Planned Features (Not Implemented)

~~The Template Management System would have provided a comprehensive solution for storing, managing, and applying analysis workflows, selection criteria, calibration settings, and well plate configurations. This system would have addressed the needs of both novice and expert users by providing reusable templates that ensure consistent and reproducible analysis protocols.~~

## Conclusion

~~The Template Management System provides a powerful foundation for consistent, reproducible cell sorting workflows. By addressing the needs of both novice and expert users, it enables teams to standardize procedures while maintaining flexibility for advanced research applications.~~

**This feature will NEVER be implemented. CellSorter maintains a focused design philosophy prioritizing direct analysis workflows over template management complexity.**
