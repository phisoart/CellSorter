# CellSorter Design System Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the design system specifications defined in `DESIGN_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Theme System**
   - Created `src/services/theme_manager.py` with full theme management capabilities
   - Supports light/dark theme switching
   - Integrated qt-material theme support
   - Applies HSL color values from design specifications

2. **Design System Components**
   - Created `src/components/design_system.py` with base components:
     - Button (with variants: default, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive)
     - Input (with states: default, focused, error, disabled)
     - Card (with Header, Content, Footer)
     - Dialog (modal with overlay support)
     - Label (with variants: default, muted, title, description)

3. **Scientific Components**
   - Created `src/components/scientific_widgets.py` with:
     - ScatterPlotWidget (design system compliant placeholder)
     - ImageViewerWidget (design system compliant placeholder)
     - WellPlateWidget (fully implemented 96-well plate visualization)

4. **Design Tokens**
   - Created `src/config/design_tokens.py` with centralized tokens:
     - Colors (Light, Dark, Medical themes)
     - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
     - Spacing (consistent spacing scale)
     - Border radius values
     - Shadows
     - Transitions and animations
     - Component sizes
     - Responsive breakpoints

5. **Color System Updates**
   - Updated `src/config/settings.py` to use HSL color values
   - Replaced hex colors with design system HSL values
   - Aligned medical/scientific colors with design specifications

6. **Theme Integration**
   - Updated `src/main.py` to initialize theme system on app start
   - Updated `src/pages/main_window.py` to integrate theme manager
   - Implemented functional theme toggle button

7. **Project Structure**
   - Created `src/services/` directory for business logic
   - Maintained separation of UI components and business logic
   - Followed lowercase_with_underscores naming convention

### üîÑ Partially Implemented

1. **Existing Widget Updates**
   - `scatter_plot.py` - Added theme manager support (needs full refactor)
   - `selection_panel.py` - Needs design system styling
   - `well_plate.py` - Needs to use new WellPlateWidget

2. **Dialog Updates**
   - Existing dialogs need to inherit from design system Dialog class
   - Need to apply consistent styling

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

1. **Full Widget Refactoring**
   - Existing widgets need complete refactoring to use design system
   - Need to replace hardcoded colors with theme colors
   - Need to apply design tokens for spacing, typography, etc.

2. **Accessibility Features**
   - ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Keyboard navigation enhancements
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast mode

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
   - Touch-optimized controls for mobile
   - Panel collapsing behavior

4. **Animations**
   - Loading states with skeleton loaders
   - Micro-interactions
   - Transition animations

5. **CSS Integration**
   - Full integration of `style.css` with Qt stylesheets
   - Dynamic CSS variable replacement
   - Theme-aware styling

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Widget Refactoring**
   - Refactor `scatter_plot.py` to fully use design system
   - Update `selection_panel.py` with Card components
   - Replace existing `well_plate.py` with new implementation

2. **Update All Dialogs**
   - Refactor calibration, export, and batch process dialogs
   - Apply consistent Dialog component styling

3. **Implement Accessibility**
   - Add accessibility properties to all components
   - Implement keyboard navigation patterns
   - Add ARIA labels throughout

4. **Add Missing Components**
   - Implement Toolbar and StatusBar components
   - Create Table component as specified
   - Add navigation components (Sidebar)

5. **Testing**
   - Test theme switching functionality
   - Verify color contrast ratios
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Validate accessibility features

## Technical Debt

- PySide6 import errors in development environment (runtime dependency)
- Need to ensure qt-material is added to requirements
- Some components are placeholders pending full implementation

## File Changes Summary

### New Files Created:
- `src/services/theme_manager.py`
- `src/services/__init__.py`
- `src/components/design_system.py`
- `src/components/scientific_widgets.py`
- `src/config/design_tokens.py`
- `docs/design/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

### Files Modified:
- `src/main.py` - Added theme initialization
- `src/pages/main_window.py` - Integrated theme manager
- `src/config/settings.py` - Updated to HSL colors
- `src/components/widgets/scatter_plot.py` - Added theme support
- `src/components/__init__.py` - Added design system exports

## Conclusion

The core design system infrastructure is now in place with theme management, design tokens, and base components implemented. The next phase involves refactoring existing components to fully utilize the design system and implementing the remaining UI/UX features specified in the design documents.
